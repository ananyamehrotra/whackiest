Coding club of my college conducts an yearly hackathon, me and my team built a nationwide healthcare records mangement system
# Nationwide-Health-Record-Management-System
A prototype webpage of an idea that contains records of the entire nation
For the wHACKiest hackathon 2024, our team's idea revolved around making health history a priority. There have been many more cases of death due to inaccurate health than due to insufficient healthcare. Our idea aims to reduce that by having the patient history securely displayed on the website.
Only the healthcare provider and the patient will be able to view the history of the patient, and only the healthcare provider will be given read and write access. This is our idea that we hope is implemented in our country in the near future.
